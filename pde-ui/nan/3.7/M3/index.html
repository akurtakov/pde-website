<h1>Eclipse "New and Noteworthy" Template</h1>
<p>Last revised October 29, 2007</p>
<p>This is the template for the "New and Noteworthy" document that
  accompanies each Eclipse project milestone build.</p>
<p>Note: This template document is XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Please use the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">XHTML
    Markup Validation Service</a> to check your document's markup before submitting.
    This will detect screwed up HTML tags, images without an "alt"
  attrribute, and other tedious little details. </p>

<p>
API Tooling ant tasks that previous supported exclude lists now support include lists. The include list seeds the 
set of bundles and members to be analyzed (when omitted, all bundles and members are included), and the exclude list
is then applied.  Include lists have the same structure as the exclude lists, allowing specific bundles/members, regular
expressions and comments to be added.</p>

<td valign="top" width="70%"><p>The API Consumer Use Report Conversion task is a new ant task that generates an HTML report
from the XML result of a use scan.  The information is organized in a different format than the standard report converter
produces.  The references are organized by consumer bundle, the bundle which contains the code that references the API/type.
The standard report organizes references by the bundle that produced the API/type.</p>
