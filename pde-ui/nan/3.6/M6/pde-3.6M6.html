<h1>Eclipse "New and Noteworthy" Template</h1>
<p>Last revised October 29, 2007</p>
<p>This is the template for the "New and Noteworthy" document that
  accompanies each Eclipse project milestone build.</p>
<p>Note: This template document is XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Please use the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">XHTML
    Markup Validation Service</a> to check your document's markup before submitting.
    This will detect screwed up HTML tags, images without an "alt"
  attrribute, and other tedious little details. </p>

<td valign="top" width="70%">You can now manage the set of bundles launched
in an Eclipse Application by selecting a set of features. PDE automatically
launches all of the bundles in the selected features along with all of their required bundles.
On the <b>Plug-ins</b> tab, choose '<b>features selected below</b>' to display
and edit features to launch.

 Features in the workspace are used over external features - however, this
can be configured by un-checking '<b>Use features from workspace if available</b>'.
Bundles in the workspace are used over external bundles in the
target platform. However, this can be configured by modifying the default
bundle resolution policy which can be configured at the feature level.

<td valign="top" width="70%">You can now manage the set of bundles in a target
platform by selecting a set of features. Additionally, you can select from
bundles that are not contained in any feature. On a target definition's 
<b>Content</b> tab select the <b>Manage using Features</b> radio button. This
provides coarse grained management of bundles in a target. When a feature
is selected, all bundles in that feature are added to the target.
