<h1>Eclipse &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; Template</h1>
<p>Last revised October 29, 2007</p>
<p>This is the template for the &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; document that
  accompanies each Eclipse project milestone build.</p>
<p>Note: This template document is XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Please use the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">XHTML
    Markup Validation Service</a> to check your document's markup before submitting.
    This will detect screwed up HTML tags, images without an &quot;alt&quot;
  attrribute, and other tedious little details. </p>
<table border="0" width="80%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">

  <tr id="itemname">
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Item title, in bold, no trailing
        punctuation, with unique id attribute on &lt;tr&gt; </b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">A blurb pitched to the Eclipse community
        (not just to members of the Eclipse Platform development team). Tell
        end users about changes they'll see at the UI. Tell component writers
        about changes they'll see at the client- and server-side APIs. Try to
        generate some excitement; save the boring details for the manual. The
        description should be complete sentences, with trailing punctuation.
        Stick to the default font and size.
      <p>If a small image sheds light, place it below the description, in a separate
        paragraph. Regular screen snapshots should be done on Windows XP. Crop
        out any extraneous stuff to focus the reader's attention on your new
        feature. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The image should be
        no more than 466 pixels wide and in PNG-24 format</span> (as opposed
        to GIF, TIF, BMP, or JPG).</p>
      <p>Microsoft Paint actually saves to PNG on Windows XP and can easily be
        used to crop and save screenshots:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrange the windows for the shot</li>
        <li>Use the Print Screen key (or Alt+Print Screen) to capture the screen</li>
        <li>Open Paint (under All Programs &gt; Accessories)</li>
        <li>Ctrl+V to paste</li>
        <li>Select the area you want to keep</li>
        <li>Ctrl+C to copy it</li>
        <li>Ctrl+N to create a new canvas (ok to discard old one)</li>
        <li>Ctrl+V to paste selected portion</li>
        <li>Save As PNG</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Name the file is a way that is appropriate and specific to the item
        (e.g., key-bindings.png, rather than something generic like image.png).
        Use all lowercase letters in the image file name, including the &quot;.png&quot; 
        file extension. As a separator, use hyphen &quot;-&quot; rather than
        underscore 
        &quot;_&quot;. </p>
      <p>Put all the images in a sibling directory named &quot;images&quot;.
        This gives HTML like &lt;img src=&quot;images/foo.png&quot; alt=&quot;The
        Foo View&quot; /&gt;. Include a suitable alt property (which is mandatory
        in XHTML 1.0). Do not embed the width and height of the image.</p>
      <p>The images should be left justified (as opposed to centered). </p>

  <tr id="targetPrefPage">
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Target platform preference page </b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top"><p>A new preference page supports managing and editing of multiple target platforms (Plug-in Development &gt; Target Platform (Experimental)). The page displays all targets defined in the workspace. You can change the target platform used build workspace plug-ins by checking it in the table.</p>
      <p><img src="images/target-pef-page.png" alt="Experimental Target Platform preference page"/></p>
    <p>A wizard is used to add and edit target platform definitions. You can seed a target platform from existing templates (for example, an RCP application), default settings, current target platform settings, or start from scratch. Target definitions created from the preference page are stored locally with workspace metadata.</p>
    <p><img src="images/add-target-wiz.png" alt="Wizard used to create a new target definition" /></p>
    <p>The content page is used to modify the name, description, plug-ins, and environment settings associated with a target.</p>
    <p><img src="images/edit-target-wiz.png" alt="Wizard used to edit target definition"/></p>
    <p>You can add plug-ins to a target definition from various sources: a directory, an installation (for example, an Eclipse SDK), a feature, or an update site.</p>
    <p><img src="images/add-plugins.png" alt="Add plug-ins dialog"/></p>
    <p>You can select specific plug-ins to include from each source (for example, a directory), by pressing &quot;Edit...&quot;. You can choose to include plug-ins by name and/or version. When a version is not specified the plug-in with the highest version identifier is used.</p>
    <p><img src="images/select-plugins.png" alt="Plug-in selection dialog" /></p>
    <p>The old preference page will be removed in future milestones and for the Galileo release. </p></td>

  <tr id="targetEditor">
    <td valign="top" align="left"><b>Target editor enhancements </b></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>The target editor has been enhanced to support new features in target definitions. Targets now support installation based locations (in addition to directories and features). As well, the editor support retrieval of plug-ins from update sites. The wizards used to add content to a target definition are the same as described in the new target platform preference page (above). </p>
    <p><img src="images/target-editor.png" alt="Target Definition Editor" /> </p>
    <p>To support new features, the underlying target file format has been enhanced. The new editor continues to read old target files, but only writes files in the new format.</p></td>

  <tr id="systemLibrary">
    <td valign="top" align="left"><b>System library validation  </b></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>API tools analyzes use of system libraries and creates problems when code accesses members that may not be present at runtime. For example, when a plug-in specifies a required execution environment of J2SE-1.4, but the only JRE installed in the workspace for building is J2SE-1.6, it is possible to access methods that exist in 1.6, but not in 1.4. In order for the validation to work, you must install relevant execution environment descriptions from an update site.</p>
      <p><img src="images/ee-validation.png" alt="API Errors/Warnings preference page" /> </p>
      <p>The API Errors/Warnings preference page displays installed execution environments. Use the &quot;install them now&quot; hyperlink to install additional environments via the software updates dialog. </p></td>
