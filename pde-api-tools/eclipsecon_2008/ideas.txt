Eclipsecon 2008 ideas

1. Do not talk about architecture at all, there just isn't enough time, and most people won't care for such a 'young' project
2. Integrate quick demos into the talk (talk for bit, show a demo, talk for bit, etc)
3. Topics to talk about:
	a. what is the project all about? (sell it to the audience)
		- providing tooling to help with api evolution
		- api consistency
	b. what can users expect?
		- tooling for use from the command line / builder integration / IDE integration
		- quick fixes for a variety of issues
		- variety of tools to help plugin developers (expand on these)
	c. what is the project not?
		- not a code gen tool, does not create apis
		- does not work if you don't set it up
	d. how can it help developers? (new / medium / experts)
		- api evolution
		- api contracts
		- api consistency
	e. what is the current state of the project? (what can they see now)
		- building / marker support in IDE
		- reference extraction
		- searching (limited)

	f. talk about some of the features like the ability to extract refs, use from the command line, builder integration, searching, integration in the IDE
