<p>Eclipse components are delivered as zip files. Each zip file contains a collection
  of features and plug-ins. Typically the zips contain all function that a particular
  component has to offer. It is often the case that consumers either need more
  than one component and/or only need parts of some components. Without assistance,
  consumers would have to manually fetch the zips containing the superset of
  the function they need and then manually extract the required features and
  plug-ins. This can be a laborious and error prone process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, PDE contains a batch oriented mechanism, the <em>packager</em> which
  can help. In short, the packager takes as input a list of zips containing features
  and a list of interesting features. It then fetches the zips, extracts the
  features (and their plug-ins) and repackages them into an output zip.</p>
<h3>Packager configuration files:</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>packager.properties</strong></dt>
  <dd>A Java properties file that controls the packaging process</dd>

  <dt><strong>customTargets.xml</strong></dt>
  <dd>An Ant file used to customize different aspects of packaging</dd>
  <dt> <strong>packaging.properties</strong><br>
  </dt>
  <dd>A Java properties file that controls the files included at the root
    of the archives and file permissions</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Quick start: </h3>
<p>Below is a set of basic steps to get started with the packager. More information 
  is available near the various properties in the actual packager configuration 
  files. It is suggested that you build *nix packages on a *nix machine to ensure 
  that file permissions are assigned correctly.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a directory to host the packaging work (we'll use <em>c:\temp\newPackaging</em> 
    here)</li>
  <li>Unzip the <a href="packager.zip">packager template files</a> into c:\temp\newPackaging</li>
  <li>Customize the files as follows:<br>
     Changes in the packager.properties: 
    <ul>
      <li> update <strong>baseDirectory</strong> to be suitable for you</li>
      <li> update <strong>featureList</strong> to indicate which features you want to be included in your archive</li>
      <li>update <strong>componentFilter</strong> to list the components that will contribute the features (if you don't know put *) </li>
      <li>update <strong>contentFilter</strong> to identify the type of content to be included in the packaging</li>
      <li>update <strong>config</strong> to indicate the platform configuration for which you are packaging</li>
      <li> if you are running on linux, set <strong>zipArgs</strong> to -y </li>
    </ul>
    Changes in the customTargets.xml: 
    <ul>
      <li> update the <strong>getMapFiles</strong> target to indicate the map file for the version you want to package. 
      The example map provided is referencing the 3.0 components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>In a shell, change to the install dir of the Eclipse you want to use to 
    <strong>run</strong> the packager and execute: 
    <pre>
eclipse 
    -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner 
    -buildfile &lt;full path to Eclipse&gt;\plugins\org.eclipse.pde.build_3.0.0\scripts\package.xml 
    -DpackagingInfo=c:\temp\newPackaging 
</pre>
  </li>

</ol>

<h3>Packager map file format: </h3>
The map files are used to describe the various zip, their content and where they can be fetched from. They are alike the map file for the build process.
The format of a map file entry is as follow:
<br>
archiveName = url "|" [configList] "|" [directory] "|" [contentDescription] "|" [componentName]
</br>

<ul>
<li>archivename: represents the name of the archive</li>

<li>url: the url where to find the archive (the concatenation of url and zip points to the file to download)</li>

<li>configList: an optional "&" separated list of configurations for which the zip 
matches. win32,win32,86 & linux,gtk,x86. If nothing is specied, the archive content is platform independent</li>

<li>directory: the directory where the content of the archive should be go relatively to an eclipse install </li>

<li>contentDescription: flags indicating the content of the drop</li>

<li>componentName: the name of the component</li>
</ul>

eclipse-platform-M20040818-win32.zip=http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/M-M20040818-200408180800/ | win32,win32,x86 | | runtime | ide<br>

#Map file entry for EMF (platform independent)<br>
